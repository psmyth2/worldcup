# worldcup semi-final sentiment analysis
Using locational data from Twitterâ€™s Search API and tools from the NLTK library, 
sentiments of over 20,000 user tweets from the World Cup semi-final matches
were analyzed and classified using a Naive Bayes Classifier.

Results are then displayed in a map-based visualization. 

This repo includes ipython notebooks used to collect tweets and build, refine and test
the sentiment analyzer.
